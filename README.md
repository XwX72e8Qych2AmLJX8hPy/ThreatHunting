# ThreatHunting
<b>I completed the Introduction to Threat Hunting certification by Security Blue Team. Performed indicators of compromise (IOC) analysis using Mandiant IOC Collector. After creating a set of IOC files from sample downloads I documented the file name, file size, file path, and file hashes for md5, sha1sum. I later used Mandiant Redline to create a custom IOC script and search those IOCs within real malware on a Windows 10 machine hosted in VMware.
